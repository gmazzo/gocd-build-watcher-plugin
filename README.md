### Access Go Server API
This plugin requires access to Go API to fetch status of previous job execution and material changes.

1. Enter [plugin settings](#access-go-server-api)
2. Enter API username and password:

### Adding Slack notifications
As this pluging needs to resolve user's email into a Slack ID, a *WebHook* is not enough to work.
You need to install our Slack App into your team and get an API token.
> ![Profile Warning](static/profile-warning.png)<br>
> You may see this warning when authorizing our app to work with your team.
> We will only access your team profile in order to match a email from a Material change into a Slack ID
1. Install our app into your team: <br>[![Add to Slack](https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png)](https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?&client_id=170776918258.170870737557&scope=chat:write:bot,users:read.email,users:read)
2. Copy your Slack API Token into GoCD's plugin configuration
3. (optional) Configure a custom channel or slack id for the bot. If a channel is set, messages will still @mention a user. If not set, commits with an author that can't be resolved to a user in Slack will be posted to #general by default. Enter [plugin settings](#access-go-server-api) and then:
